# For using Ganache in Windows across WSl

### Steps are as follows

1. IN the WSL Terminal install Ganache and run ganache, which will give the RPC Port.
2. In Ganache settings => server => Change the Hostname to ALL INTERFACE and Port Number to the RPC port number.
   This gives an interface for seeing the block transactions.
